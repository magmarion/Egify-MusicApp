## How It Works

1. **Homepage** displays a collection of all available songs.
2. **Playlist Page** allows:
   - Selecting a **genre**
   - Viewing all **artists** in that genre
   - Viewing all **songs** by the selected artist
3. Songs are loaded from a `data.json` file in the local environment.
4. The playlist generation and navigation logic is handled in JavaScript (Controller layer).
